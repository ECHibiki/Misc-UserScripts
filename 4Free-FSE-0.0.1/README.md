### Visible Password
#### Shows your 4chan post/delete password
* Displays your 4chan password in an inputbox.
* Top left is the post password, Bottom right is the delete password.
* Edit the input boxes to change them.

__Note:__ some 4chan boards don't allow custom post passwords. May require cookie manipulation, but this has not yet been tested...
